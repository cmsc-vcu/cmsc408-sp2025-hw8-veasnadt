# Exercises

In the following exercises, write the SQL as requested to discover the answer.

## Task 1

How many records are in the country table?

```{python}
# How many records are in the world_bank_data.wdi_country table?
# (skills: select, aggregate)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  count(*) as "Row Count"
from
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
""")

```

## Task 2

Explore the first 5 records in the country table.

```{python}
## write out the first 10 records and look at the columns

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
select
  *
from 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
limit 5
""")

```


## Task 3

List all non-countries.

```{python}
## task 3
## Which records are NOT for countries, that is they're for regions or groups of countries.
## How can you tell?
## Once you figure it out, write a query to list all the non-countries
## (skills: select, where)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT 
  `Short Name`
FROM 
  world_bank_data.wdi_country
WHERE 
  Region IS NULL
""")
```

## Task 4

Create your own copy of WDI_Country containing just countries.

```{python}
## task 4
## The WDI table clearly contains information for countries and non-countries
## using CREATE TABLE ... SELECT from WHERE syntax.
## Finally, below write a query to return the number
## of records in the new table.
## (skills: select, aggregate)

# drop table
execute_ddl(cnx,"""
drop table if exists wdi_country;
""")
```

```{python}

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT COUNT(*) AS 
  number_of_countries
FROM 
  wdi_country_only;
""")

```

## Task 6

What are all unique values of region in the wdi_country table?

```{python}
## Let's investigate the country_region field.
## What is the domain of the country_region field? That is,
## what are the unique values found there?
## (there are several possible ways to code this in SQL)
## (skills: select, aggregate, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT DISTINCT Region
FROM wdi_country_only
ORDER BY Region;
""")

```

```

## Task 8

List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america.

```{python}
## List the country full names and regions for all countries in north america
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT 
  `Long Name`, Region
FROM

```

## Task 10

```{python}
## There are two abbreviation fields in the data country_abbr and country_wb_abbr.
## List the country code, short name, abbr, wb_abbr and region for all the countries
## where the abbr and wb_abbr are different.
## (skills: select, where, order by)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

```

## Task 11

```{python}
## Now, let's investigate the "income category" field.

""")

```

## Task 12

```{python}
## Mystery task.  Looking at the table from Task 11 (anything odd?) write the
## next obvious query based on the results in the table.
## At a minimum, your query should put country short name in the first column.
## you will be scored on the number of records returned and the value(s) 
## in the first column.

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""
SELECT `Short Name`
FROM wdi_country_only
WHERE `Income Group` IS NULL
ORDER BY `Short Name`;

```

## Task 13

```{python}
## OK, this HAS to be an error. Let's make a assumption that the country 
## in question, because they are oil-rich, are "high income".  
## Write an update comment to correct the issue.
## NOTE - if you get this wrong, all subsequent tables will be wrong!

execute_ddl(cnx,"""
UPDATE wdi_country_only

```

## Task 15

```{python}
## Examine the result from task 14. It would be really cool to
## present the results of this table in a 2-D form, with 
## columns for each income category (high, upper middle, lower middle, low, other)
## regions down the side, and the pair-wise count inside each cell.
## Using CASE statements, DO IT!  BE SURE to include the countries without
## an income category.

## HINT - your query should return 6 columns: the region name, one
## column for each of the income categories (e.g., High, Upper middle, etc.)
## and a column for the row totals.
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

```

## Task 16

```{python}
## Wow! what a cool table!  It is very interesting to see where the money
## sits around the world.  Using the general approach from Task 14 above
## and write a query to return the single region with the most lower-income
## countries.

## Your query should return 3 columns, the number of 
## low-income countries, the region name and the income group

## PUT THE NUMBER FIRST! (use: count, region name, income group)
## (skills: select, aggregate, group by, nested query, order by, limit)

run_sql_and_return_html(cnx,"""

## Task 17

```{python}
## Are you getting the hand of this? Good! We need to take a look at all
## the countries in the same region and with the same income category as
## the Marshall Islands.
## For each country that matches, print their country code, short name,
## region and income category, by order of their short name.  As a hint,

## Task 18

```{python}
## OK - let's raise the heat in the kitchen! Review the output from task 14.
## You'll see that some of the regions do not contain all of the income
## levels.  For example, the Europe & Central Asia region does not have
## any low income countries.
##
## CHALLENGE - using a SINGLE SQL statement, write a table that contains every
## combination of region and income category (including the missing '') values!
##
## THEN add a WHERE clause to only show the values that were missing from
## the original pairings!
##
## HINT - there should be AT MOST [# of regions]x[# of income cats] = 28
## rows in your final table, and there are 22 rows returned in the query
## in Task 14.  (FYI - I get 6 rows in my final table.)

# Reflection

1. Reflect on the SQL skills you used throughout these exercises. Which skills do you feel most confident in, and which do you think need more practice? How has this assignment helped you build or reinforce specific SQL competencies?

Throughout this assignment, I practiced several important SQL skills, including basic queries (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY), aggregation (GROUP BY, COUNT), and data modification (UPDATE). I feel most confident with simpler queries and grouping data to summarize results. However, I found the use of more advanced operations like CASE statements, complex nested subqueries, and joins (especially in Tasks 18, 19, and 20) more challenging. These areas clearly require more practice. Overall, the assignment significantly reinforced my SQL foundation and highlighted areas where I need more practice, such as complex joins and conditional aggregations.

2. Problem-Solving Approach: Describe your approach to tackling the more complex tasks (like Tasks 18, 23, and 24). How did you break down these problems, and what steps did you take when you encountered challenges? How would you approach a similar problem differently in the future?

For the complex tasks, particularly Tasks 18 and 20, my approach involved first clearly identifying what the question was asking and then gradually breaking down the query into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, in Task 18, I started by listing out all possible combinations clearly and then used a cross join to generate those pairs before identifying missing ones. When challenges arose, especially syntax errors, I carefully checked my quotes and column identifiers and tested smaller parts of queries independently. In the future, I’d approach complex tasks by building incrementally and verifying each step individually before combining them.

3. Learning Takeaways: Consider the overall learning experience from this assignment. What were the biggest takeaways about working with SQL for data analysis and transformation? How do you think these skills will apply in real-world scenarios or future coursework?

The most important takeaway from this assignment was the power and flexibility SQL provides in data analysis. I learned how useful SQL is in quickly summarizing and pivoting data to gain insights, like comparing countries by income group and region. I also realized how important it is to pay close attention to syntax details—quotes, backticks, and exact column names—since small mistakes can lead to errors. These skills are highly applicable to real-world data analysis scenarios, such as summarizing sales data or categorizing customer demographics, and I anticipate applying these SQL skills frequently in both future coursework and professional settings.
